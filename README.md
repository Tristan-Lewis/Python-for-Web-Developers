<h1 align="center">Achievement 1 Project: Recipe App (Command Line Version)</h1>

<h2 align="center">Objective</h2>

<p align="center">Build the command line version of a Recipe app, which acts as a precursor to its
web app counterpart in Achievement 2.</p>

<h2 align="center">Context</h2>

<p align="center">    Building a website with the Django web framework is almost entirely done in Python, and takes advantage
of Python’s object-oriented nature. You may also be required to modify your code in the event of any
updates to Django—here, it helps to understand the instructions and syntaxes provided. Debugging for
errors and exceptions also becomes an easy task with the concepts outlined in this Achievement.</p>

<p align="center">This project primarily focuses on learning Python fundamentals, data structures, and object-oriented
programming. You'll also learn how to interact with databases using Python, which will help you when you
have to do the same with the Django framework. The project also aims to teach you standard
programming practices that will make your code simpler, easier to read, and robust during execution.</p>

<h2 align="center">User Goals</h2>

<p align="center">Your users should be able to create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty
parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app. Your users should also be able to search for
recipes by their ingredients.</p>

<h2 align="center">Key Features</h2>

- Create and manage the user’s recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database.
- Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user.
- Automatically rate each recipe by their difficulty level.
- Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time,
and difficulty of the recipe.

Big shout-out to [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) for teaching me the technologies I needed to make this happen!
